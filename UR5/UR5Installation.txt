## UR5 installation
Install some dependencies that were not covered from rosdep:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-moveit
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-industrial-msgs


Clone in your catkin workspace:
We're not getting the newest version from: because ...
$ git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git

ROSDEP
https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/183


Since we're not getting the newest version, in order to bring the robot up we have to install
the following package:
$ git clone -b kinetic-devel git@github.com:ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver.git

Go to the root of your catkin workspace and:
$ catkin_make



UR5 is usually tethered with an ethernet cable, meaning it has an IP

to bring the robot up:
$ roslaunch ur_modern_driver ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.131.12



## Using the Robotiq 2 gripper

Permission to open the gripper's port
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0

Interfacing the gripper with ROS:
$ rosrun robotiq_2f_gripper_control Robotiq2FGripperRtuNode.py /dev/ttyUSB0

To make the usage easier we create an alias that concatenates both commands:

``` $ cd ~/ ´´´
``` $ echo "open-gripper() { sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 ; rosrun robotiq_2f_gripper_control Robotiq2FGripperRtuNode.py /dev/ttyUSB0 ; }" >> .bashrc ```
